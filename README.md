# JNJProgressButton

As part of the [Objective-C Hackathon](https://objectivechackathon.appspot.com) I thought I'd take a shot at building a button to display progress, much like the progress button in the new iOS 7 version of the App Store. This progress button is inspired as a blend of UIButton and UIProgressView with a few other things tossed in. Maybe it will be useful, maybe it will just be fun. You decide.
